        <h2>Aspiring Full Stack Developer by Day · Game Dev by Night</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I’m Arnold Christian — full stack developer-in-training by day, hobbyist game developer by night. I’ve been hooked on computers since I was a kid, from tinkering with hardware to crafting software. Follow along as I trade my hard hat for a keyboard and code my way from geotechnical engineer to self-taught software engineer.
