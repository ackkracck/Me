                Hey there! I’m Arnold Christian — full stack developer-in-training by day, hobbyist game developer by night. 
                I’ve been hooked on computers since I was a kid, from tinkering with hardware to crafting software. 
                Follow along as I trade my hard hat for a keyboard and code my way from geotechnical engineer to self-taught software engineer.
